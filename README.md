## About

 <p>The web application allows real-time activation and deactivation of specific commands from the web application, where sections can be activated:</p> 
  <ul>
      <li> commands for points</li>
      <li> commands for bits</li>
      <li> commands sent in chat</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Streamer has the ability to automatically download tokens from twitch or spotify apps, which allows for a quick and virtually non-invasive ability to implement the bot.</p>
  <p>In addition, a bot has been written that allows users of the stream to trigger previously enabled commands using the aforementioned methods.</p>
